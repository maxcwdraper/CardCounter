  "Each player is dealt a face up card, including the dealer. Then every player is dealt a second face up card, except the dealer who draws their second card face down. The goal of the game is to get as close to 21, adding up the value of your two cards and choosing whether or not to get an extra card. If any player is dealt an Ace and any card worth 10 points (a 10 card or a face card), then that player gets blackjack and instantly wins their bet multlpied by one and a half times. If the dealer has an Ace or a card valued 10, they check their face down card to see if they have 21. If they do (and no players have natural 21), they gather up the bets, and deal again. If a player also has natural 21 at the same time as the dealer, they take their chips back. When every player (and the dealer) has 2 cards, play begins at the player to the left of the dealer. The first player can decide to either 'hit' (receive another card) or 'stand' (keep the cards they currently have). If the player busts (gets too many points and goes over 21) then they lose their bet and play moves on to the next player. Play continues until all players stand or bust, at which time the dealer will flip their face down card. If the dealer's total is 16 or less, they must hit. If the dealer's total is 17 or higher, they must stand. When the dealer finishes their play, the round is over and anyone who is closer to 21 without busting receives their payout. Anyone further than the dealer from 21 or anyone who busted loses their bet.";
