  "There are many variations to the game of poker with different names, all of which have their own quirks and rules. These rules will only be explaining the different hand types (not including Wild card hands). The best hand in poker is the Straight Flush, which requires you to have five cards of the same suit and sequential value. The highest scoring straight flush hand is called a Royal Flush, it being an Ace, King, Queen, Jack, and 10 all of the same suit. The next hand is Four of a Kind, which requires you to have four cards of the same value, with the fifth card not mattering. The next tier down is the Full House, needing three cards of a single matching value and two cards of another matching value, essentially a Three of a Kind and a Pair combined. Below a Full House is a Flush, which is five cards of the same suit, not in sequential order. Next is a Straight, five cards in sequential order but not of the same suit. The lowest hands are Three of a Kind (three cards of the same value), then Two Pair (two sets of matching values), and One Pair. If you don't have any of the hands mentioned before, then your hand is labeled 'High Card' and is defined by the highest value card in your hand.";
