  "The deck of cards is split evenly between two players. Both players have their deck in front of them face down, and will flip one card at a time. Whichever player's card's value is more wins both cards, putting them face down on the bottom of their deck. If both players have a card with the same value, place an additional card face down into the play area. Once again both players will draw a card from the top of their deck, with the higher value card taking all cards in the War and adding them to the bottom of their deck, including the face down ones. If both players play cards with the same values again, repeat the process. The game ends when one player has all the cards in the deck.";
